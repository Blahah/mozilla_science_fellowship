## Projects

Along with @joeyklee, we coined [the 'sprint' model for the fellowship](https://github.com/mozillascience/fellows-class-2015/blob/master/fellowship_sprints.md) 

- [ScienceFair](https://github.com/codeforscience/sciencefair) - a distributed science library now funded by eLife [approaching v1]
- [Command-line bootcamp](rik.smith-unna.com/command_line_bootcamp) and its [github repo](https://github.com/Blahah/command_line_bootcamp). A browser-based adventure where you learn the unix command-line from scratch. Beginner friendly! [fairly complete]
- [slidewinder](https://github.com/slidewinder/slidewinder) - a new way to make, share and remix slides [incomplete]
  - my [activity log](https://github.com/slidewinder/direction/issues/3)
  - my [intro blog post about this sprint](rik.smith-unna.com/2016/01/11/starting-to-sprint-with-slidewinder/)
- [MozMap](http://joeyklee.github.io/mozmap2015/) - an app to help you navigate the conceptual landscape of MozFest created by @joeyklee and I during MozFest 2015 [usable, but will be improved before Mozfest 2016]
