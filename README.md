# Mozilla Science Fellowship 2015-2016

Keeping track of my work during my Mozilla Science Lab Fellowship

### Stuff you can look at:

#### Sprint projects:

Along with @joeyklee, we coined [the 'sprint' model for the fellowship](https://github.com/mozillascience/fellows-class-2015/blob/master/fellowship_sprints.md) 

1. [slidewinder](https://github.com/slidewinder/slidewinder) - a new way to make, share and remix slides
  - my [activity log](https://github.com/slidewinder/direction/issues/3)
  - my [intro blog post about this sprint](rik.smith-unna.com/2016/01/11/starting-to-sprint-with-slidewinder/)

#### Other products/projects that arose during my fellowship

These may be in various states of completion and are not likely to be as well documented as the sprint projects.

- [Command-line bootcamp](rik.smith-unna.com/command_line_bootcamp) and its [github repo](https://github.com/Blahah/command_line_bootcamp). A browser-based adventure where you learn the unix command-line from scratch. Beginner friendly!
- [MozMap](http://joeyklee.github.io/mozmap2015/) - an app to help you navigate the conceptual landscape of MozFest created by @joeyklee and I during MozFest 2015
- [My directory of openness](https://github.com/Blahah/how_to_open)
- [My introductory course on open science](https://github.com/Blahah/intro_to_open_science)

#### Getting and managing the fellowship

- [My application for the fellowship](https://github.com/Blahah/mozilla_science_fellowship_application)
- [My talk to the other fellows + Mozilla Science Lab team](http://blahah.net/fellows-onboarding-talk) at the first Fellows week (and the [source code](https://github.com/Blahah/fellows-onboarding-talk))
- The [issues](https://github.com/Blahah/mozilla_science_fellowship/issues) where I track planned and on-going work.
